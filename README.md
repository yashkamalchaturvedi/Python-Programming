# Python Programming

This repository contains chapters from basic to intermediate level coding in Python.

## Documentation

[Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, you can reach me out at [Yash Kamal Chaturvedi](https://twitter.com/yashkamalchatu1?lang=en).

## Installation

You will need to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), a Microsoft code editor (or any other source code editor of your choice). It is one of the finest code editors available, offering a highly pleasant programming experience.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about the following :

1. What are Comments in Python? (single,multi-line)
2. What are Variables in Python? (rules)
3. What are types of Operators in Python? (arithmetic,relational,logical,bitwise,assignment)
4. What are Decision Making Statements in Python? (if-else,switch-case)
5. What are Loops in Python? (while,for,do-while)
6. What are Functions in Python?
7. What is Recursion in Python
8. What is String in Python? (slicing,methods)
9. What are Lists in Python? (slicing,methods)
10. What are Tuples in Python? (methods)
11. What are Dictionary in Python? (methods)
12. How to perform operations on a file in Python? (read,write,append,open,close)

## Optimizations

I use these VS code extensions to support my development workflow.

1. esbenp.prettier-vscode
2. formulahendry.code-runner
3. ms-python.python
4. ms-python.vscode-pylance

## FAQ

#### Who is the founder of Python?
- Guido van Rossum

#### What are the benefits of using Python?
- Python is a general-purpose programming language that has simple, easy-to-learn syntax which emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
- Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, completely open-source and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code-reuse.

#### Why it is an Interpreted language?
- An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. 
- Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. 
- Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.
